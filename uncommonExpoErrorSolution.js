// uncommonExpoErrorSolution.js
// This file provides a potential solution, but the exact solution depends on the specific error encountered.
// The approach focuses on a systematic debugging process rather than a specific code fix.

// 1. Examine Expo CLI logs for detailed error messages and stack traces.
// 2. Check the project's `package.json` file for dependency conflicts, outdated packages, or mismatched versions.
// 3. Carefully review the Expo documentation for relevant configuration settings and guidelines to ensure compliance.
// 4. Try updating or downgrading the Expo CLI and related packages to identify potential version incompatibility issues.
// 5. Perform a clean build by deleting the `node_modules` folder and running `npm install` or `yarn install`.
// 6. If using third-party libraries, check their documentation for any known compatibility issues with Expo.
// 7. Consider creating a minimal reproducible example to isolate the problem.
// 8. Search for similar issues in the Expo community forums or GitHub issue tracker.

// The specific code fix will depend entirely on the error encountered. This file highlights the overall debugging strategy.
