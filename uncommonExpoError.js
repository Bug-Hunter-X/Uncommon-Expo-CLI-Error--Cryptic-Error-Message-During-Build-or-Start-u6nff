This error occurs when using Expo CLI with a project that has a specific configuration or dependency conflict.  It's not a common error, making it difficult to diagnose without more context.  The error message itself is usually unhelpful, providing limited information about the root cause.  The error might manifest as a cryptic error message during the build process, a failure to start the development server, or unexpected behavior within the app itself.  Debugging requires examining the Expo CLI logs for clues, checking package versions, and ensuring that the project's configuration adheres to Expo's requirements.  If the project uses third-party libraries, ensuring compatibility is vital.
