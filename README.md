# Uncommon Expo CLI Error: Cryptic Error Message During Build or Start

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error encountered when using the Expo CLI. The error is characterized by a cryptic message that doesn't immediately indicate the root cause.  This often happens due to configuration issues, dependency conflicts, or incompatibility between Expo versions and project dependencies.  The example provided illustrates such a scenario and offers a potential solution.

**Problem:**

The error typically manifests during the build or start process of an Expo project. The Expo CLI produces a cryptic error message, making it difficult to trace the issue to its source.

**Solution:**

The solution involves a methodical approach to debugging. This includes carefully examining Expo CLI logs, inspecting package.json for dependency conflicts, ensuring that the project's configuration adheres to Expo's guidelines, and checking for incompatibilities with recently updated Expo versions or third-party libraries.

**How to Reproduce (Example):**

The `uncommonExpoError.js` file contains a simplified representation of a project that might exhibit this behavior. The error may be triggered by a specific configuration or dependency, which isn't directly illustrated within the example code but rather is intended to represent a general scenario.  The precise error might vary depending on your project's setup.

**Troubleshooting Steps:**

1. Check Expo CLI logs for detailed information.
2. Examine `package.json` for dependency conflicts or outdated packages.
3. Verify your project's configuration against Expo's documentation.
4. Try updating or downgrading Expo CLI and relevant packages.
5. Clean and rebuild the project.
6. If using third-party libraries, check for compatibility issues.
